**Description**

This mod introduces high-quality gameplay improvements while maintaining a "vanilla" feel. It is designed for maximum compatibility.

> **Installation Note:** To avoid issues, install this mod **last**, after all your other favorite modifications are in place.

**Important Notes:**
- This mod includes all features from my previous work, **Gore Mechanics Revamped**. I recommend trying that mod first to see the evolution of these features.
- This version was rebuilt from scratch to fix the messy code management of the original release.
